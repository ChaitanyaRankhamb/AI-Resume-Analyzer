Password Strength Analyser
Technologies used: Java, OOPs Concepts, Java Swing (GUI)
Designed and developed a desktop application that evaluates the strength of passwords in real-time based on various
parameters like length, character variety (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols), and common patterns. Implemented
object-oriented principles to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability of the application. Utilized Java Swing to
create a user-friendly graphical interface that dynamically reflects the password strength and provides suggestions for
improvement. Enhanced application security awareness by educating users about weak passwords and encouraging
best practices.
Facial Expressions Detection & Music Player
Technologies used: Python, OpenCV, Deep Learning (CNN), Tkinter, MediaPlayer Libraries
Built an intelligent music player that detects real-time facial expressions using a webcam and plays music based on the
user's emotional state (e.g., happy, sad, neutral). Integrated a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model

to accurately classify facial expressions. Used OpenCV for real-time image capture and facial landmark detection.
Developed an intuitive GUI using Tkinter for smooth user interaction and playback control. Enabled emotion-based
personalization to enhance user experience by linking detected moods to curated playlists.
