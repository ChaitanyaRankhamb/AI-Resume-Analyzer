Task Scheduling Algorithms in Cloud Computing: A Review
Article History: Received:11 January 2021; Accepted: 27 February 2021; Published online: 5 April 2021
Abstract: Cloud computing is the requirement based on clients and provides many resources that aim to share it as a
service through the internet. For optimal use, Cloud computing resources such as storage, application, and other
services need managing and scheduling these services. The principal idea behind the scheduling is to minimize loss
time, workload, and maximize throughput. So, the scheduling task is essential to achieve accuracy and correctness
on task completion. This paper gives an idea about various task scheduling algorithms in the cloud computing
environment used by researchers. Finally, many authors applied different parameters like completion time,
throughput, and cost to evaluate the system.
Keyword: Cloud Computing, Cloud Services, Task Scheduling.
1. Introduction
Cloud computing is a distributed computing system that offers software, CPU, memory, storage, and other
computing resources. It provides on-demand services as a pay-per-use service through the internet. Cloud computing
is used to construct and operate the cloud computing environments of virtualizing technologies (Anushree B, 2018;
Manju Arora, 2020; Rashid et al., 2018). It allows sharing a single application or physical resource among multiple
clients, and load balancing can be handled by virtualization (Hanan M. Shukur, 2020; Rashid et al., 2019). The IT
Cloud computing model mainly focuses on the ease and speed of assigning IT resources, freeing end-users from IT
infrastructure and location problems(Zeebaree et al., 2015). All of this is presented in a pay-as-you-go manner
(Gibet Tani Hicham, 2016; Haji, Zeebaree, et al., 2020; M. A. Sadeeq et al., 2018). Cloud environments provide
service providers and internet providers. The service provider is responsible for the software, network, and facilities
used to create the service. Simultaneously, internet providers are also called customers or consumers of the Cloud
(Abdulazeez et al., 2018; C. Thirumalaiselvan, 2017).
Cloud Operating Systems (COS) are commonly used with individual and business customers due to cloud
technology's rapid growth (Zebari et al., 2011). The COS is an operating system on the server that deploys
application software. Users do not have to install and link the app through a Web browser from the personal
computer (Shukur, Zeebaree, Zebari, Zeebaree, et al., 2020). The cloud provider is responsible for storing and
handling cloud storage data, protecting, upgrading the software, minimizing the costs of using the software, and
effectively enhancing user experience (Alam, 2020; Salih et al., 2020; Zhen Du, 2017).
The task scheduling algorithm allocates user tasks to the cloud resources to maximize usage rate, reduce the
make span, and balance the cloud infrastructure to avoid activities from being overburdened (Fahd Alhaidari, 2019;
Iqbal, 2019; Safwat A. Hamad, 2016; Xiaozhong Geng, 2019). The scheduling could be either static or dynamic. In

Task Scheduling Algorithms in Cloud Computing: A Review
1042
static planning, the scheduler identifies the specifics of the resources and tasks (S. Zeebaree et al., 2020). While in
dynamic scheduling, the details of tasks and resources are undefined from the beginning (Sallow, Sadeeq, et al.).
The scheduler makes dynamic scheduling plans to select appropriate resources for user activities (A. M. Senthil
Kumar, 2018; Dinkan Patel 2018; Kadda Beghdad Bey, 2019). The significant elements in cloud technology are
resource providers, task/service schedules, and clients. Scheduling can be defined as the period a resource is
allocated to a request. The responsibility of scheduling algorithms is allocating resources to task requests in the
Cloud (Arghavan Keivani 2018; S. R. Zeebaree et al., 2020).
The rest of our paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces cloud types and services. Section 3 provides
cloud scheduling. Section 4 presents a literature review related to the scheduling algorithm, Comparison and
Discussion are provided in Section 5, and the conclusion is in Section 6.
2. Cloud Types and Services
The Cloud model can be analyzed from an organizational view into different types and can be distinction depend
on the extent to which the user's and providers' organizational units are separated from each other (Z. Ageed et al.,
2020; Haji, Ahmad, et al., 2020). Cloud models can be classified as illustrated in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Types of Cloud
Public clouds: enables users to use the Cloud through web browser interfaces. Users need to pay-per-use
services or resources (Aaqib Rashid, 2019). The public Cloud is available by some companies like google, amazon
Microsoft. Private clouds: this type of Cloud resides inside the organization for its internal use to exclusively
support its business operations. More protection is controlled by the private cloud than a public cloud (Shukur,
Zeebaree, Zebari, Ahmed, et al., 2020). Many medical offices, banking, and other organizations use private Cloud to
store their data on this type of Cloud (Abdulla et al., 2020; Z. S. Ageed et al., 2020). Hybrid Cloud: in this type, the
services distribute between private and public, where critical applications are stored within the network of the
organization, and other services could be stored outside the network of the organization (Christian Baun, 2011;
Laffly, 2020; Pradeep Krishnadoss, 2018; Waleed Abd Elkhalik, 2018). Cloud infrastructure offers three distinct
service models that meet a number of market criteria. Figure 2 below shows both services:

Saas provides user friendly applications through a web browser or via specific services based on the cloud. For
example, Google Docs, Gmail, and Google Talk are the most popular providers (Abdulraheem et al., 2020; Dino et
al., 2020; Laith Abualigah, 2020; Omar M. Ahmed, 2020). PaaS provides different computing services to the user
for implementation, execution, testing, and hosting application or program. Different services come under this
model: a database for storing data and an operating system to provide the execution environment (M. Sadeeq et al.,
2020). Google App Platform and Microsoft Azure Platform are the most common providers. IaaS allows the user,
through virtual machines, to access the underlying infrastructure, giving the user more flexibility than PaaS. It helps
the user to find out its required infrastructure through the internet (Yazdeen et al., 2021). The most common
examples are Amazon Cloud and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) (Abdullah et al., 2020; Ahmed Meri Kadhum, 2017;
Ram Shringar Rao, 2021).
3. Cloud Scheduling
The concept of cloud scheduling refers to the technology for mapping jobs to a range of virtual machines or
assigning virtual machines to use the resources available to fulfill user requirements (Sallow, Zeebaree, et al.;
Shukur, Zeebaree, Ahmed, et al., 2020). The purpose of using scheduling methods in cloud computing is to enhance
system throughput and load balancing, reduce costs, increase resource utilization, save energy, and reduce
processing time (Hasan et al., 2021). Scheduling manages CPU and memory availability; a good scheduling plan
increases resource utilization (D.I. George Amalarethinam, 2017; Nora Almezeini, 2018; Sharif et al., 2020).
Scheduling can be classified into jobs and task scheduling. Most of the job scheduling techniques are present in a
computing system are appropriate enough to be used in the cloud system (Rashid et al.). The benefit of using job
scheduling algorithms is to obtain the best performance and maximum system throughput (Sulaiman et al., 2020).
Job scheduling can be classified into the following group of algorithms: Batch Mode Heuristic Scheduling
Algorithms (BMHA), Online Mode Heuristic Algorithms, Dependency mode heuristic Algorithm (Pratisha Sarma,
2017).
While the task scheduling techniques are used to find the order in which tasks or activities should be completed.
It focuses on mapping the user tasks to the available resources. The backbone for efficient task scheduling is
virtualization (Jghef et al., 2020). Nevertheless, its performance could affect the performance of the cloud
environment. Beast scheduling methods minimize the total time completion of the task, improve device load
balancing, and improve resource usage (Mohammed et al., 2021). Task scheduling can be classified into the
following group of scheduling algorithms: static, dynamic, workflow, cloud service, real-time, Heuristic, and
opportunistic load balancing (OLB) scheduling algorithms (Amandeep Kaur, 2018; Yanyue Yu, 2019). Users have
sent their tasks to the Cloud, and they must allocate them to the processor. It is now a question of how processor
tasks are allocated such that the cloud owner earns the least time and maximum benefit (M. M. Sadeeq et al., 2021).
The work programming fixes the problem that tasks are assigned to the processor that takes account of the other
factor. Figure 3 shows the cloud system schedule of a mission (Kalka Dubeya, 2017):

4. Literature Review
In 2016, Zhifeng Zhong, and et al. (Zhifeng Zhong, 2016), introduced a Greedy Particle Swarm Optimization
(G&PSO) approach to resolve task scheduling. The findings indicate that the suggested algorithm improved each
virtual machine's performance, such as well local and global search abilities, a faster convergence rate, and a more
balanced workload. Hence the Greedy Particle Swarm Optimization outperforms the classical PSO in terms of
maximize utilization of resources.
In 2016, WANG Bei and Li Jun (WANG Bei, 2016), considered a Multi-Population Genetic Algorithm (MPGA)
for load balancing, is applied to solve task problems in the cloud system prevent premature convergence. In this
work, several methods depend on which min-min and max-min approaches have been used to initialize the
population. Then the metropolis criterion is applied to screen the offspring where the flawed individual could be
admitted. Then the population diversity can be preserved, and it is even possible to prevent the optimum local. The
obtained results showed that the MPGA could achieve good task scheduling results, such as minimize cost and
execution time.
In 2016, Ruonan Lin and Qiang Li (Ruonan Lin, 2016), A pre-allocation Ant Colony Optimization (PACO)
method was suggested for task scheduling in the cloud system. This algorithm incorporates the improved Ant
Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm and the template size to individual schedule tasks. The proposed algorithm
has good efficiency inside the simulated software. The experiments demonstrate that the PACO Scheduling
productivity will enhance the task.
In 2017, Hu Yao et al. (Hu Yao, 2017) described a "three-stage selection method," and the genetic approach of
"total-division-total" is put forward to enhance genetic strategy. The obtained results from the CloudSim tool
indicate that the enhanced algorithm outperforms a simple genetic algorithm (SGA) in the term task completion
time. It is a robust algorithm for cloud computing task scheduling.
In 2017, Ashish Gupta and Ritu Garg (Ashish Gupta, 2017), a meta-heuristic method of the ant colony
optimization algorithm was suggested to resolve task scheduling in the cloud system focusing primarily on two
targets, i.e., reducing makespan/computation time and optimizing load balancing. The study results indicate that the
suggested load balancing ant colony optimization algorithm (LB-ACO) produces better results than the NSGA-II
algorithm in the makespan and balancing load.
In 2017, Xing Jia Wei and et al. [41] proposed a Simulated Annealing Multi-Population Genetic Algorithm
(SAMPGA) algorithm to resolve the scheduling issue. To prevent the local optimum and enhance the optimum
global efficiency, SA is inserted into SAMPGA. Simultaneously, a family evolution method based on the adaptive
mechanism in MPGA is suggested to find a suitable solution and enhance convergence speed. The simulated result
illustrates that the SAMPGA has a good result for enhancing the task's completion time, cost, and balance load.
In 2017, Jaspnder Kaur and Brahmalen Kaur Sidhu (Sidhu, 2017), a new algorithm for task scheduling using the
Flower Pollination Algorithm (TSFPA) was implemented to assign resources the task. The algorithm aims to
decrease the task execution time (makespan). The efficiency of the suggested method (TSFPA) was compared with
many other approaches such as genetic algorithm (GA), First Come First Serve (FCFS), and Round Robin (RR)
scheduling approach, the result of the suggested approaches is better than compared algorithm concerning
makespan.
In 2017, Danlami Gabi and et al. (Danlami Gabi, 2017), a Multi-Objective QoS approach was presented to
resolve customer expectations using execution time and cost parameters. In order to solve the model, Cloud Scalable
Multi-Objective Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) based Simulated Annealing (SA) (CSM-CSOSA) approaches were
suggested. The Taguchi Orthogonal technique is applied to enhance the simulated annealing and incorporate the
proposed algorithm into the local search to improve its exploration ability.
In 2018, N. Gopalakrishnan and C. Arun (N. GOBALAKRISHNAN, 2018) proposed a hybrid Genetic Gray
Wolf Optimization Algorithm (GGWO) to resolve and improve the task scheduling issues. The obtained result
indicates that the suggested method reduces computing time, the cost of migration, and load usage compared to
QWO and GA algorithms.

In 2018, Mehran Ashouraei and et al. (Mehran Ashouraei, 2018) presented the parallel genetic algorithm-based
approach for scheduling tasks with priorities to use resources effectively and minimize resource waste in cloud
systems. This method is carried out by increasing the load balance when selecting good resources for short-term
arrival tasks in order to eliminate work failures.
In 2018, Fang Yiqiu and Li Xiaosheng (L. X. Fang Yiqiu, 2018), Introduced a real-time improvement ant colony
algorithm for a virtual machine (VM-ACO). In order to finish the task's load balance, the method takes into
consideration time. The findings demonstrate that the VM-ACO technique outperforms the ant colony algorithm in
terms of resource state and polling, task latency, and time to accomplish the task and load balance.
In 2018, Shuang YIN (Shuang YIN, 2018), A new preparation algorithm was implemented that uses double-
fitness algorithm-load balance and cost completion genetic algorithm (LCGA). The schedule ensures a balance of
load which reduces the cost of completing the mission. The LCGA algorithm is comparable to the load-balancing
genetic algorithm (LGA) and the task-complete cost genetic algorithm (CGA) reveals that a programming
algorithm's performance and optimization approach is usable in the simulation experiment.
In 2019, Negar Chitgar and et al. (Negar Chitgar, 2019), a technique for scheduling workload based on the
virtual machine grouping in the cloud system was implemented. The suggested approach aims to enhance the cloud
environment's performance by decreasing make span and response time and maximizing virtual machines' usage.
Using various performance metrics, the proposed algorithm is superior to other existing methods.
In 2019, Fang Yiqiu and et al. (X. X. Fang Yiqiu, Ge Junwei, 2019), Binary coded chromosomes for resource
scheduling is suggested to be a strategy for premature optimization of the risk of cross-over mutation in adaptive
genetic algorithms (AGA). The improved genetic algorithm (AGA) is compared to the standard genetic Algorithm
(SGA). The findings of the CloudSim tool show that the improved approach has an effective planning algorithm.
In 2019 A.M.Senthil Kumar and et al. (A.M.Senthil Kumar, 2019) proposed successful hybrid task scheduling to
reduce the overall execution time using Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
algorithms. PSO helped GA achieve better results in the hybrid Genetic Algorithm - Particle Swarm Optimization
(GA-PSO algorithm compared to the standard genetic algorithm, Min-Min, and Max-Min algorithms.
In 2019, Ping Zhu et al. (Ping Zhu, 2019), a power-aware and real-time scheduling (PRTS) algorithm were
proposed to decrease workflow costs and reduce energy consumption. There are two components of the proposed
algorithm: scheduling the most cost-effective virtual machines based on the critical path without missing the
deadline, tracking the dynamic slack, and reclaiming them to implement the energy-saving DVFS technique.
In 2019, Abdullah Alzaqebah et al. (Abdullah Alzaqebah, 2019), This study used a Grey Wolf Optimization
(GWO) algorithm with fitness function modifications by making it manage multi-objectives in single fitness; the
makpane and cost are the targets used in fitness to resolve the issue of task scheduling. The primary aim of the
proposed approach is to minimize both cost and makespan. The obtained results from the CloudSim tool indicate
that the proposed MGWO algorithm outperforms both the traditional GWO algorithm and Whale Optimization
Algorithm (WOA) in terms of cost, make space.
In 2019, Abdulsalam Alsmady et al. (Abdulsalam Alsmady, 2019) a Memetic Algorithm (MA) was proposed to
solve cloud workflow-scheduling, considering cost and time as two goals to optimize the scheduling of scientific
workflows in a cloud system. As an additional operator for the Genetic Algorithm (G.A.), the (MA) algorithm used
the local search algorithm for the hill climbing to improve individual solutions during a global search.
In 2019, Shengmei Liu and Yari Yin (Shengmei Liu, 2019) improved discrete particle swarm optimization
algorithm (IDPSO) used a sinusoidal strategy-based dynamic inertia weight optimization approach to make particles
adaptive to various phases in a search for the optimal global solution. The results show that the IDPSO approach
outperforms the DPSO and FCFS algorithm based on completion time and convergence.
In 2019, SHAN CHEN PANG et al. (SHANCHEN PANG 2019) An efficient hybrid algorithm proposed for
Distribution Estimation Algorithm and genetic algorithm (EDA-GA) to resolve the issue of multi-objective task
scheduling with the target of minimizing the execution time of the task and enhancing the ability to balance the load
of the environment. The suggested method first uses EDA operations to create some suitable solution, then uses a
genetic algorithm to produce new solutions depend on the optimal solution chosen in the previous stage to extend a

search scope of solutions. The findings results indicate that the proposed algorithm has excellent convergence speed
and search capability.
In 2019, Raja Masadeh et al. (Raja Masadeh, 2019) proposed the algorithm's vocalization for humpback whale
optimization (VWOA). The VWOA mimics humpback whales' vocalization behavior, and in a cloud system, it is
used to optimize task scheduling. A suggested multi-objective model is the basis of the VWOA scheduler. It reduces
completion time, cost, and energy usage and maximizes the use of resources. The experiment results on the test data
showed that the VWOA scheduler has better performance in terms of cost, makespan, and the degree of imbalance,
resource utilization, and energy consumption than the results of the standard whale optimization algorithm (WOA)
and round-robin (RR) algorithm.
In 2020, Yong Shi and et al. (Yong Shi, 2020) proposed a BMin algorithm to enhance the Min-min algorithm's
efficiency. A cloudsim simulation program evaluates the proposed algorithm, and the result indicates that the
suggested algorithm reduces completion time, maximizes throughput, and enhances the load balance among
resources.
In 2020, Sanj M S et al. (Sanaj M S, 2020) suggested an improved Round Robin (ERR) technique to increase
efficiency without influencing classical RR functionality. The CloudSim toolkit applies and tests the proposed
algorithm. The results indicate the total waiting time for the tasks in a specific number of cloudlets in ERR is
minimized under the same conditions compared to classical RR.
In 2020, Vijayalakshmi A. Lepkshi et al. (Vijayalakshmi A. Lepaksh, 2020) proposed an Efficient Resource
Allocation with Score (ERAS) for scheduling task in cloud environments, which considers Virtual Machines (VM)
temporary operational availability by suggesting different types of delays and EFT to set the processor for
scheduling tasks to a standardized score. The results obtained show that the ERAS algorithm's improved reliability
provides better efficiency compared to current approaches that only regard EFT for allocations.
In 2020, Zhong Zong et al. (Zong, 2020) Suggest a combination of the methodology of dynamic fusion mission
planning, genetic approach and ant-colony system. This limits the energy consumption of cloud computing data and
storage facilities. The test results demonstrate that the suggested approach in the task programming would
substantially minimize cloud computing device time and energy usage.
5. Comparison and Discussion
This paper aims to overview various algorithms proposed by researchers in the previous studies for scheduling
tasks in cloud computing. There are many challenging schedule issues in cloud computing infrastructure like
computation time, load balancing, resource utilization, cost, and QoS. According to their experiments, there are
good results for many algorithms compared to another algorithm under the same condition. For example, the author
in reference (Zhifeng Zhong, 2016) proposed an algorithm (G&PSO), the obtained results show that it reduces the
overall task completion time compared to the practical swarm optimization algorithm. While the author in reference
(Ashish Gupta, 2017) suggested (LB-ACO) algorithm to minimize the make span and distribute the load in balance,
the proposed algorithm results are better compared to the NSGA-II algorithm. Table 1 summarizes the previous
study reviewed in this paper and related to task scheduling in cloud computing.
